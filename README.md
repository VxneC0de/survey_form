# Survey Form

> This page is based on a Free Code Camp project on Responsive Web Design, specifically the survey-form project. Here we will show a form with questions for a survey for some facility, in my case I decided to be inspired by the Vidamed medical center. Likewise, since it is a Free Code Camp project, the methods, tags, properties, among others, required to finish the page were used.
